This is a Godot project I'm working on for fun.
It's a physics sandbox, it will have many tools the player can use to interact 
with and manipulate objects.


Current features:

    Grab object
    
    Release object
    
    Freeze object
    
    Rotate object
    
    Throw object

    Push/pull object
