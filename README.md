This is a Godot project I'm working on for fun.
It's a physics sandbox, it will have many tools the player can use to interact 
with and manipulate objects.


### Current features:
* Grab objects
* Throw objects
* Freeze objects
* Rotate objects
* Push/pull objects
* Alter gravity of objects
* Spawn/delete objects (WIP)
* Scale objects (WIP)
* Reset momentum of objects
